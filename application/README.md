# Sympl_Auction Application

The application server and can be started by going into the `api` directory and looking at the readme. There is no GUI for this api server.

This application allows users to create auctions and bid on items, and is based off the logic of the underlying sympl_auction application.

The purpose of this application is to have a basic example of how to build something on top of Assembly in python, using our python client and it is not intended to be a production-ready application.
